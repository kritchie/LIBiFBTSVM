# Contributing to LIBiFBTSVM

We welcome any help, questions, feature requests and/or contributions.

To ensure that the experience goes smoothly, this guide contains a few guidelines to help maintainers review the contributions.

## Asking questions

We are happy to help any user of the library. First, please be familiar with Stackoverflow's page on [how to ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

## Reporting bugs and opening issues

Github is the platform on which we track bugs and issues.

Ideally with a small, reproducible snippet.

Again, Stackoverflow provides a [helpful guide](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)
on how to create reproducible examples.
